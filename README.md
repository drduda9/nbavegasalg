NBA Vegas Lines Exploratory Analysis

First time project in my Data Science course through Springboard. I plan to analyze the results of the current NBA season; I will aim to determine and explain the information gap between my calculated lines and Vegasâ€™ lines.

EDIT

As this project progressed, it became an exploratory analysis into the accuracy of Vegas and their predictions and where gamblers can identify the best situations to capitalize and make money. 

The analysis covered 1031 games from Oct. 17, 2017 to March 16, 2018. The areas covered include home spread accuracy and trends, over/under accuracy and trends, total wins per team from a statistical prediction model as well as a deeper dive into accuracy over time.
